## Hello world! üëã

I am a biomedical engineer interested in leveraging biomechanics, robotics, and data science in orthopaedics to inform surgical treatment strategies and improve clinical outcomes.

<!-- I'm passionate about solving real world problems in medicine and sustainable development through engineering! -->

I am a graduate research assistant in the [Lenz Research Group](https://medicine.utah.edu/orthopaedics/research/labs/harold-dunn/groups/lenz) of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Utah School of Medicine pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Engineering focused on foot and ankle orthopaedic biomechanics.

My dissertation research aims to develop a robotic simulator for studying the kinematic mechanisms and interactions of the individual ankle and hindfoot joints and how different arthrodeses impact their underlying functionality. This work combines biomechanics, robotics, controls, and machine learning for a unique interdisciplinary approach to understanding the form and function of the foot and ankle complex.

I am also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Deep Learning in AI & Robotics in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah to enhance my skills in robotics and machine learning through coursework in machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and medical robotics.

******

## Career Objective üöÄ

My overall career goal is to utilize robotics and machine learning to solve real-world problems and make positive impacts in society, especially in disadvantaged communities.

I am interested in working as a research/data/machine learning scientist in medical robotics, health technology, sustainability, or climate technology.

## Background

I grew up in Spartanburg, SC and earned my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Applied Mathematics at Wofford College in 2015. Following graduation, I interned as a research chemist at the E. & J. Gallo Winery Research Laboratory in Modesto, CA. Eventually, my coupled interests in medicine and engineering evolved and I moved to Corvallis, OR to complete my MS in Bioengineering with a minor in Robotics at Oregon State University. Under the guidance of [Ravi Balasubramanian](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/ravi-balasubramanian) and Jim Sweeney, I computationally modeled the kinematics and dynamics of a novel implantable passive differential mechanism for upper extremity tendon transfer surgery.

After completing my MS, I was awarded an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Fellowship to conduct research in the Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. As a research fellow, I collaborated with surgeons to design biomechanical cadaveric studies across multiple orthopaedic specialties, including sports medicine, spine, and trauma.

When I am not designing hardware or troubleshooting code, I am out mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, or hiking with my dog and friends.
