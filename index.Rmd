## Hello world! Welcome to my website!

üëã I'm an orthopaedic biomechanist interested in using biomechanics, robotics, and data science in orthopaedics to inform surgical treatment methods and improve clinical outcomes.

<!-- I'm passionate about solving real world problems in medicine and sustainable development through engineering! -->

I'm currently a graduate research assistant in the [Lenz Research Group](https://medicine.utah.edu/orthopaedics/research/labs/harold-dunn/groups/lenz) of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Utah School of Medicine, pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Engineering focused on foot and ankle orthopaedic biomechanics. My dissertation aims to apply machine learning and model predictive control on a robotic simulator for replicating foot and ankle biomechanics in a cadaveric model and evaluate individual joint compensation motions in the hind- and midfoot due to musculoskeletal pathologies, injuries, and/or surgical interventions.

My overall career goal is to leverage engineering and data science to solve real-world problems and make positive impacts in society, especially in disadvantaged communities. Areas of interest include health technology, sustainable development, and climate technology.

## Background

I grew up in Spartanburg, SC and completed my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Applied Mathematics at Wofford College in 2015. After graduation, I interned as a research chemist at the E. & J. Gallo Winery Research Laboratory in Modesto, CA. Eventually, my coupled interests in medicine and engineering evolved and moved to Corvallis, OR to complete my MS in Bioengineering with a minor in Robotics at Oregon State University, where I worked on the development of a novel implantable passive differential mechanism for ECRL-to-FDP tendon transfer surgery with Ravi Balasubramanian and Jim Sweeney. In 2020, I was awarded an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Fellowship to conduct research in the Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. As a research fellow, I worked with clinicians to design experiments to characterize the biomechanical properties of various joints, including the elbow, knee, spine, and foot/ankle, in intact, injured, and repaired cadaveric models to inform surgical treatment strategies. When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy mountain biking, rock climbing, and skiing with my dog and friends.
