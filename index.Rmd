## Hello world! Welcome to my website!

üëã I'm an orthopaedic biomechanist interested in using biomechanics, robotics, and data science in orthopaedics to inform surgical treatment methods and improve clinical outcomes.

<!-- I'm passionate about solving real world problems in medicine and sustainable development through engineering! -->

I'm a PhD candidate and graduate research assistant in the [Lenz Research Group](https://medicine.utah.edu/orthopaedics/research/labs/harold-dunn/groups/lenz) in the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Utah School of Medicine pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Engineering focused on foot and ankle orthopaedic biomechanics. My dissertation work aims to apply robotics, machine learning, and model predictive control to characterize the individual joint mechanics of the ankle and hindfoot in a cadaveric model for improving our understanding of how they compensate and interact in response to injury, surgical interventions, abnormality, or implant design.

I'm also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Deep Learning in AI & Robotics in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah to enhance my skills in robotics and machine learning through coursework in machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and medical robotics.

******

## Career Objective üöÄ

My overall career goal is to leverage robotics and machine learning to solve real-world problems and make positive impacts in society, especially in disadvantaged communities.

I'm interested in working as a research/data/machine learning scientist in medical robotics, health technology, sustainable development, or climate technology.

## Background

I grew up in Spartanburg, SC and completed my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Applied Mathematics at Wofford College in 2015. After graduation, I interned as a research chemist at the E. & J. Gallo Winery Research Laboratory in Modesto, CA. Eventually, my coupled interests in medicine and engineering evolved and moved to Corvallis, OR to complete my MS in Bioengineering with a minor in Robotics at Oregon State University, where I worked on the development of a novel implantable passive differential mechanism for upper extremity tendon transfer surgery with [Ravi Balasubramanian](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/ravi-balasubramanian) and Jim Sweeney. In 2020, I was awarded an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Fellowship to conduct research in the Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. As a research fellow, I worked with surgeons to design biomechanical cadaveric studies across multiple orthopaedic specialties, including sports medicine, spine, and trauma. When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy mountain biking, rock climbing, and skiing with my dog and friends.
